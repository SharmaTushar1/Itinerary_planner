Basic nlp concepts

1. Segmentation: Separating by sentence.
2. Tokenization: Making tokens (sepearating by space)
3. Predicting POS (parts of speech) for each token
4. Lemmatization: Getting the base form
5. Identify stop words: remove unnecessary words that add noise like the, end, etc. (depends on the context of what you're building. Example a thing can have a name 'the')
6. Dependency parsing: find the root and create a relationship dependency. In addition, we can also find the type of relationship between these two. Or instead of this we can have multiple nouns instead of single words. Ex: most populous city.
7. NER (Named Entity Recognition): Used to find:
	1. People's name.
	2. Company's name.
	3. Geographic locations
	4. Product names
	5. Dates and times
	6. Amounts of money
	7. Names of events
